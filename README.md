## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learned a little more about media queries for adding complexity to my layouts.

```js
// regex pattern for valid email address from mdn web docs
const regex =
  /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;
```

### Continued development

Going forward i think media queries and regular expression would be my thing because i find it interesting how with a good understanding about media queries i can take on pretty much any challenge about layout and also with regular expressions control user input.

### Useful resources

- [Regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) - This helped me wrapped my head around regex. I really liked it.

- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This mdn article about media queries gave me a good overview and also some useful understanding about media queries.
